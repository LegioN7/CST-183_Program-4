Write a Java program that will determine the risk of severe weather at a given weather station by utilizing measurements
taken from a weather balloon. Weather balloons are used to observe upper air measurements.
There are several severe weather indexes used by meteorologists. Two are included in this assignment. Each include a
simple arithmetic formula and are defined to calculate values based on patterns and conditions likely to produce severe
weather. They offer a forecaster a quick number that can be referenced to assist in judging weather risks on a given day.
These measurements taken via weather balloons are not taken at standard heights, but instead at standard pressure
levels (in the unit of millibars). The severe weather indexes your program will calculate require the following values (â„ƒ):
